Packet Sniffer (Educational Use Only) is a network analysis tool built in Python using Jupyter Notebook that captures and inspects real-time network packets. It extracts and displays essential information such as source and destination IP addresses, communication protocols (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP), and raw payload data. This project is designed to help learners understand how data travels across networks, how packet structures work, and how low-level network monitoring is performed using Python libraries like socket and scapy. The tool provides a hands-on, interactive learning experience within a Jupyter environment. This tool must only be used on networks you own or have explicit permission to monitor. Unauthorized packet sniffing is illegal and unethical. Intended for educational and research purposes, this open-source notebook serves as a practical introduction to network security and traffic analysis.
